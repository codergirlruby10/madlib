# madlib
A fun madlib game using the terminal

#Description
A terminal game that takes input from the user to create a super funny story. There is only one story to be used however the main story and user input can be changed in 
order to switch things up. 

#Usage
I played this game with my daughter and she found it hilarious. Can be used as entertainment for children especially during quarentine. 

#Challanges
This is the first project I created using c++. I'm still not super familiar with syntax. I ran into small problems such as using endl. I thought the(l)
was the number one instead of lowercase L. While doing some research as to why my project wouldn't build I discovered that I wasn't the only person
who thought this and of course it would make sense to be an L because I'm assuming in means 'end line'. 
I also learned that if the project doesn't build, when you try to run the code it will run the previous build. For instance when configuring
my compiler I like to use 'hello world' to make sure it's working and even though I had all my new code laid out the build wouldn't work because of said issue (l)
the only thing that would print in terminal was 'hello world' instead of an error message. 
I used https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux#_cc-configurations to set up the debugger and compiler.
